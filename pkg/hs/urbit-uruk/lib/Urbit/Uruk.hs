{-
    This is an extremely simple (and very, very slow) Uruk evaluator.

    It evaluates Uruk by applying reduction rules until we reach a normal
    form, and printing the expression after every reduction.

    This is an extremely dumb evaluation strategy, but it's dead simple
    and closely matches the spec. It's also a useful debugging tool,
    since it shows each reduction step.
